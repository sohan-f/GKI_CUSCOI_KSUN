# Install with PixelFlasher

Alternative flashing app with advanced options.

> [!CAUTION]
> Flashing a kernel can brick your device and will void your warranty. Make a full backup (boot partition at minimum) before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

- Device with unlocked bootloader running a GKI2 kernel 5.10+
- Root access already granted to the flashing app

## Steps

1. **Download the AnyKernel3 ZIP** that matches your kernel version (e.g., `6.1.157-android14`) from the latest [Releases](https://github.com/WildKernels/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS/releases) page.
2. **Open PixelFlasher**, grant necessary root permissions when prompted.
3. **Select the AnyKernel3 ZIP** you downloaded and flash. Do not interrupt the process.
4. **Reboot** when prompted and verify KernelSU manager shows the expected version.

> [!NOTE]
> Match by the full kernel version (e.g., `6.1.157-android14`) - your device's Android version and the `android14` in the kernel version are not necessarily the same.

## About

- **Source:** [badabing2005/PixelFlasher](https://github.com/badabing2005/PixelFlasher) - alternative with advanced options
- Requires root to flash a kernel from within Android.

## After flashing

- Install / update the matching KernelSU manager APK (see release assets `manager-apk-*`).
- If using SUSFS, install the SUSFS module via the manager.
- Verify with `su` or manager app that root is working.

## Troubleshooting

- **Bootloop** - restore your boot backup via fastboot/recovery.
- **Wrong KMI** - re-flash with the correct KMI variant; KMI mismatch is the most common failure.
- **Manager shows old version** - ensure you flashed the intended variant and rebooted fully.
